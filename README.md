# nhl-for-newbies

**nhl-for-newbies** is a beginner-friendly NHL analytics project for confused-but-curious fans (like me). It uses real game and team data plus simple machine learning to estimate win probabilities, then explains *why* one team is favoured in clear language—things like recent scoring form, goaltending, rest days, and special-teams strength.

The goal is to help newer fans:
- Understand what actually drives different game outcomes.
- Decide which game might be the most fun or interesting to watch.
- Learn basic hockey analytics concepts one matchup at a time, without needing a stats background.
